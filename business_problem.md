## Background

Japan has so many earthquakes that it is called an earthquake powerhouse. In recent years, more earthquakes have occurred in Japan. On March 11, 2011, the worst earthquake called the Great East Japan Earthquake caused about 20,000 casualties. It is predicted that a huge earthquake directly under the capital will occur in Tokyo, the capital of Japan, in the near future.

If an earthquake occurs in the economic center of Japan, it will cause more damage than the Great East Japan Earthquake. Possible problems such as the collapse of a towering office building, the tsunami from Tokyo Bay, and the inundation of landfills can be easily imagined. Therefore, the ward must arrange and grasp the evacuation site area in case of an earthquake.

In this project, we will focus on Shibuya Ward, which is adjacent to various companies in Tokyo, and cluster evacuation shelters.
By doing so, the ward will be able to determine the optimal division, and in the event of an earthquake, it will be possible to guide the victims and distribute supplies smoothly.
